## Hi, decided to call the data set Food_Sec, have loaded the entire data set and would then subset it to the columns we are working on.
## There was one Raw_Data.csv file aswell that had done this already but that didn't have all the observations

Food_Sec <-  data.frame(read.csv("DATS6101-Project1-2022Fall/dec21pub.csv"))

str(Food_Sec)
FS_Subset <- subset(Food_Sec, select = c("HRHHID",	"GTCO",	"GESTFIPS",	"HRNUMHOU",	"HEFAMINC",	"HESP1",	"PTDTRACE",	"PRCITSHP",	"PEMJNUM",	"PEHRUSL1",	"PEEDUCA", "HRFS12MD"))


## Installng tidyverse to use dplyr to rename the columns
install.packages('tidyverse')

library(dplyr)

head(FS_Subset)

FS_Subset <- FS_Subset %>% rename("Id" = "HRHHID", "Counties" = "GTCO", "States" = "GESTFIPS", "Family Size" = "HRNUMHOU",	"Household Income" = "HEFAMINC",	"SNAP" = "HESP1",	"Ethnicity" =	"PTDTRACE", "Citizenship status" = "PRCITSHP",	"Number of Jobs" = "PEMJNUM",	"Hours on Jobs" = "PEHRUSL1" , "Education Level" = "PEEDUCA" , "FoodSecurity score" = "HRFS12MD")
)

head(FS_Subset)

summary(FS_Subset)
